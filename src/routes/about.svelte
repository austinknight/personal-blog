    <h1>Hi, I'm Austin</h1>
    <p>I've been a front-end software engineer for a little over a decade now. Most of my time has been spent working on early stage startups or scaling new applications at larger companies. These days I work primarily with Svelte (formerly React) and lead a team of engineers building product at Filevine. </p>
    <p>This site is where I talk about what I work on, things I'm learning, and my opinions on various topics.
